# Assignment 2 - Forms and JS
Create a web page with a form for ordering space and equipment for your sporting event (with possible alternatives). In the form, allow the user to choose if he/she wants to use the venue/field/space he/she is ordering, in what case and at what price. You will also be able to choose if you would like to meet your sporting needs and for how many people.  All these data will be stored in your computer, i.e. you will not be able to retrieve them from any database or from the server. You may contribute the content of the form, but it is necessary that the entry also meets the following requirements:

(1) In the form, the fields first name, last name, sex, date of birth and age must be sent.  Please check if the date of birth you entered corresponds to the age you entered.  If the two events are not linked, ensure that the form cannot be sent.  The age should be automatically calculated on the basis of the date of birth.

(2) There will be a minimum of 3 interlinked drop-down lists in the form, i.e.  the content of the second checklist shall depend on the selection of the item in the first checklist and the content of the third checklist shall depend on the selection of the item in the second checklist. 

(3)The time of the formula will be adjusted depending on whether the user selects the item in the selection (via the radio button), i.e. i.e. either the change is revealed or hidden or at least one position is changed (e.g. if you click koˇlko in the field and the koˇlko is measured - again, I hope you can think of something else). 

(4) One one-line text field must contain an email address that contains a minimum of 2 domains, with the top domain being 2-4 characters.   

(5) The form will also contain a checkbox, where the user will have the option to specify his answer with himself.   For example, in the formula, the question (I hope you can think of something else) is "if you play sports?" with the answers "football", "tennis", "hockey".   You should also add a possible answer such as "other, please specify if". When this option is selected, the user will be presented with a previously unseen text field in which to enter their answer. 

(6) The form will contain at least one multi-line text field (textarea) and a hidden text field in which you enter your name.   This text field can be revealed by pressing the button.

(7) The form will contain a field - the phone number - and can only be entered in the intermediate format.  A field may also consist of two fields, the first field being
the first field will contain a list of presets from which you can select and the second field will contain a list of other presets. 

(8) A number of fields, at least the first name, surname, sex, date of birth and age, shall be compulsory fields of the form and shall be indicated. 

(9) For each field on the form, provide the user with guidance on how to complete the form.  If the questionnaire is incorrectly filled in, the user should be given the opportunity to complete it immediately after it has been left (i.e.  not when the form is sent), which is exactly the error that prevents the form from being sent (even in the case of interleaved positions). 

(10) After the form has been sent, provide the user with a copy of the services he has ordered together with the total price.  The price will be generated dynamically, i.e. not by checking and unchecking the options.  

(11) The page will be responsive, i.e. adapted to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  For screen sizes from 768px and above, the page will have at least two columns.  For smaller images, the columns will be placed one below the other.  Make sure that the page displays correctly at any size of the browser window.

(12) Individual fields need to be validated.  In the case of non-supported input, it is necessary to switch the display of the label below each field (actual, not native, which is input type="submit") and to colour the field.  You can do the evaluation on each field individually or in total when you open the summary. A summary must not be opened/formulaised if it contains a non-valid input.

(13) The maximum number of characters allowed and the actual number of characters allowed (e.g. 13/20) must be displayed for each field.   Also make sure to use the correct input types (input type - text, number, date, ...).The form must have an acceptable appearance (i.e.
